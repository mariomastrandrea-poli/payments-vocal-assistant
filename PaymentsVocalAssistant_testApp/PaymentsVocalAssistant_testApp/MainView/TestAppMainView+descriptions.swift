    My name is Mario Mastrandrea and this is the test app for my Master's Thesis 🎓 in:
       "Developing an AI-Powered Voice Assistant for an iOS Payment App"
    
    Thank you for joining this test! 🙏🏻

    ✅  Test the performance of my Voice Assistant, which will then be integrated into an  application involving P2P payments 📲
    
    ✅  You are a registered user with the two (fake) bank accounts at "Top Bank", in dollars $, and "Future Bank" in dirhams AED (so you don't have a euro € account!) 🏦
    
    ✅  Imagine that your contacts are registered users too, and you can send to or request money from them 👥

    ✅  My Voice Assistant can help you perform the following tasks:
        💸  send money to another user
        💰  request money from another user
        📈  check a bank account's balance
        💳  check the last transactions (eventually involving a specific user or bank account)

    ✅  The assistant works *entirely* on your device, from voice recognition to answer generation, without sending any data over the network (isn't that great?) ‼️
        For this reason, it might be necessary to have English among your settings languages to work properly 💬
        
    ✅  If you also want a better (an more natural) voice, please download an English (US) *enhanced* voice in: Settings -> Accessibility -> Spoken Content -> Voices -> English (US) 🗣️
